## Technical Decisions Made

| Decision | Choice | Reason |
|----------|--------|--------|
| State Management | Riverpod (no setState) | Cleaner separation, testability |
| Constants | Centralized files | No hardcoded strings for assets/Firestore |
| JSON Serialization | `explicit_to_json: true` in build.yaml | Nested objects serialize properly |
| Form State | TextEditingController in StatefulWidget | Persists across navigation |
| Firestore Constants | Single merged file | Removed duplicate `firestore_paths.dart` |
| Bottom Navigation | `IndexedStack` + `navigationIndexProvider` | Preserves tab state; use provider (not go_router) for tab switching |
| Auth State | Providers watch `authStateChangesProvider` | Ensures data refreshes on account switch |
| FutureProvider | Never watch StreamProvider | Prevents "disposed during loading" race conditions |
